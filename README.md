## Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm install` in both the frontend and the api folder to install all the dependencies.

Run `nodemon app.js` in the api folder to start the backend server. Nodemon looks for the changes automatically in the api directory and restarts itself.
